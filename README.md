# About.Us

Hi there, 

Welcome. This is Honey Honey Lab, we are a small team of people who shares interest in Technology and Coffee. The combo sounds wire, but it happens. 

We code, develop, 3D-print, CNC, roast and make stuff. 

## FYI

Previously we ran an ETSY shop with Star Seller Status,  under the name < Honey Honey Trading >. Due to the difficulty of communicating with ETSY management & ETSY custom support, we have decided to close the ETSY shop and focus on our own website and shops in Tindie and eBay.

To clients who have purchased via our ETSY shop, we will honour the product warrenty and provide tech support. Please feel free to email us via Support@honeyHoneylab.com
