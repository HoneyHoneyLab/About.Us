## About.Us

Hi there,

Welcome to Honey Honey Lab. Weâ€™re a small team of people with a shared passion for technology and coffee. It might sound like an odd combo, but it works for us. 

We code, develop, 3D-print, CNC, roast, and make all kinds of things.

Feel free to reach out to us by emailing Support@HoneyHoneyLab.com.

## FYI

Previously, we operated an Etsy shop with Star Seller status under the name [Honey Honey Trading](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/HoneyHoneyTrading). Due to the challenges of communicating with Etsy management and customer support, we have decided to close our Etsy shop and shift our focus to our own websites, as well as our shops on Tindie and eBay.

For customers who have made purchases through our Etsy shop, we will continue to honor product warranties and provide tech support. Please feel free to email us at Support@HoneyHoneyLab.com.
